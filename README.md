Interactive animations using [ggplot2](https://github.com/hadley/ggplot2)'s grammar of graphics implementation combined with clickSelects and showSelected aesthetics.

## Installation

```s
if (!require(devtools)) install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github(c("tdhock/ggplot2", "tdhock/animint"), build_vignettes=FALSE)
library(animint)
example(animint)
```

NOTE: tdhock/ggplot2 is required in order to use `theme_animint` --
there is a [pull request](https://github.com/hadley/ggplot2/pull/953)
to merge [tdhock/ggplot2](https://github.com/tdhock/ggplot2) with the
main ggplot2 repo.

## Learning animint through examples

The best way to learn animint is through examples. A couple of good
introductions are Carson Sievert's [Interactive animations of
PITCHf/x](http://cpsievert.github.io/baseballR/20140818/) and Susan
VanderPlas' [animint tutorial](http://tdhock.github.io/animint/). In
addition, there is an [examples web
site](http://sugiyama-www.cs.titech.ac.jp/~toby/animint/index.html),
[examples distributed with
animint](https://github.com/tdhock/animint/tree/master/inst/examples), as
well as more complex 'big data' examples in the
[tdhock/animint-examples
repo](https://github.com/tdhock/animint-examples/tree/master/examples).

## Frequently asked questions (FAQ)

- Can I do brushing in Animint? If by "brushing" you mean "multiple
  selection," then yes the designer can use the
  [selector.types](https://github.com/tdhock/animint/wiki/Advanced-features-present-animint-but-not-in-ggplot2#multiple-selection)
  option to declare a multiple selection variable, which means that
  users will be able to click plot elements to add/remove items from
  the multiple selection set. For example see the [WorldBank-facets
  viz](http://bl.ocks.org/tdhock/raw/93a798530952338c87ac/) and
  [source
  code](https://github.com/tdhock/animint/blob/master/inst/examples/WorldBank.R).
 
- Can I use animint inside of a Shiny app?
  [Yes](https://cpsievert.shinyapps.io/animintShiny/).

- Can I use animint inside of knitr?  [Yes, but use `structure(viz,
  class="animint")` rather than
  `animint2dir(viz)`](http://cpsievert.github.io/animint/worldPop/worldPop.html)

- Can I use animint inside of an interactive Rmarkdown document?
  [Yes](https://cpsievert.shinyapps.io/animintRmarkdown/)
  ([source](https://github.com/tdhock/animint/tree/master/inst/examples/rmarkdown)).

## Animint paper

Carson Sievert, Susan VanderPlas and Toby Dylan Hocking wrote an
[academic paper describing
Animint](https://github.com/tdhock/animint-paper/blob/master/HOCKING-animint.pdf?raw=true). If
you would like to contribute code to animint, please read the paper
first to get an overview of the package. It explains: 

- the purpose of animint: make it easy to design data visualizations
which can be both animated and interactive.

- the clickSelects and showSelected keywords which permit
interactive linked plots.

- the advantages and disadvantages of animint compared to other
interactive data viz libraries.

## Contribute to animint!

#### Get acquainted

Before contributing to animint, you should first read about its design. There are two main components, which have separate wiki pages that explain their details:
- The [compiler](https://github.com/tdhock/animint/wiki/Compiler%20details) is written in R code.
- The [renderer](https://github.com/tdhock/animint/wiki/Renderer-details) is written in JavaScript code.

#### TODO items

We keep a TODO list at top of the [NEWS](https://github.com/tdhock/animint/blob/master/NEWS) file. They are categorized as follows:

- BUG: things which used to work but have stopped working. Tests should be added to prevent these. For example at one point in 2013, animint rendered the correct number of legend entries for the WorldBank viz, but in the beginning of 2014 animint rendered too many legend entries. 
- GGPLOT: things which ggplot2 supports but animint does not yet support. For example facets, coord_equal.
- DSL: changes to the animint domain-specific language (DSL) which would allow interactive/animated features. These involve changes to how we define the ggplots, and how the compiler works. For example custom alpha/color/etc for selected geoms, using selected.alpha/selected.color/etc aesthetics.
- EXAMPLE: examples to show off animint features, which should affect neither the compiler nor renderer. For example the pirates data set.
- RENDER: changes to the JavaScript rendering code which would result in better interactive plots, without having to change the definition of the ggplots. For example rendering a selection widget for every selection variable.
- OUTPUT: different output formats for viewing/sharing an interactive animation.
- OPTIMIZATION: things which are currently supported, but with an implementation that could be improved in terms of render/compile speed, disk usage, memory, etc. Typically these optimizations are not really noticed for small data sets, but make it easier to visualize large data sets. For example, can we gzip the TSV plot data files to reduce disk space and download times?

#### Submitting contributions

We are open to pull requests. If your changes pass [our tests](https://github.com/tdhock/animint/wiki/Testing), then we are happy to merge them.
