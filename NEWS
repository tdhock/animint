TODO

customizable alpha/color/size/etc for mouseovered/selected geoms. One
way to do this is by defining new *.hover aesthetics,
e.g. https://github.com/rstudio/ggvis/blob/master/demo/hover.r

theme(legend.position)

specify scale_x_continuous(LABEL) instead of xlab(LABEL).

facets

coord_equal

aes(tooltip=text) for specifying the text to show when you hover the
mouse over something, e.g. #1.

layout=matrix of plot names means render plots in an html table
instead of in a line.

Include SEVERAL d3 plots directly in knitr html output e.g.

multiple selection? ex, if 1 bin contains multiple values of
clickSelects, then can we select all of the corresponding geoms? This
would require rewriting a substantial amount of JS code, so let's just
ignore this for the time being.

Figure out when two csv files are the same and if so only write one of
them?
