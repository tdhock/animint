When testing code on travis, record how much time, disk space, memory
for compilation and rendering steps, and write those values to a CSV
file. Then make a time series plot of these data to see if the code is
getting more or less efficient. This could be useful in packages other
than animint, so I proposed a GSOC2015 project
https://github.com/rstats-gsoc/gsoc2015/wiki/Test-timings-on-Travis

DSL: allow for example
geom_tile(aes(clickSelects1=var1, clickSelects2=var2))
which means that clicking a tile changes
the selected values of BOTH selectors.

DSL: customizable alpha/color/size/fill/linetype for selected geoms,
using selected.alpha, selected.color, etc aesthetics, see
examples/Climate-selected.R. The first implementation should only
allow this at the geom level,
e.g. geom_point(aes(clickSelects=var),selected.color="red") means to
plot a bunch of points which are black if not selected and red if
selected. In ggplot2-0.9.3.1, selected.color thus defined can be
accessed as layer$stat_params$selected.color. In the future we can try
an implementation at the aes level,
e.g. geom_point(aes(clickSelects=var1,selected.color=var2)) means
black if not selected and scale[var2] if selected. NOTE: should
maintain compatibility with existing code, which assumes
selected.color="black" and color="transparent" for
e.g. geom_rect(aes(fill=numeric, clickSelects=id)) and otherwise,
selected.alpha=1 and alpha=1/2.

RENDER: Have you thought adding the ability about saving the
visualization state? I know we have ability to change the default
selection, but it would also be nice to save the state as a url
fragment -- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragment_identifier

OPTIMIZATION: Why does it take so much memory to compile large data?
e.g. My computer has 12GB RAM but starts swapping when I try to
compile examples/vervet.R.

OPTIMIZATION: Profile animint2dir() to see what part is slow, and speed
it up! e.g. the last viz in
https://github.com/tdhock/animint-examples/blob/master/examples/scaffolds.R
took 15 minutes to compile on my computer.

OPTIMIZATION: to save disk space, we can compress the TSV file
standard web servers? With servers like gist.github.com, all .json
files are served with Content-Encoding: gzip, so they use
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_compression over the network. In
firefox Inspect Element -> network it seems like they do not compress
.tsv files. In curl it seems like it depends on the --compress flag

thocking@silene:~/projects/chip-seq-paper(master*)$ curl --compress -# --head https://gist.githubusercontent.com/tdhock/914ab9c19038cae238a4/raw/geom10_rect_profiles_chunk9.tsv |grep Content-Encoding

thocking@silene:~/projects/chip-seq-paper(master*)$

DSL: Allow other variable names for the same selection variable,
e.g. insert and insert.show are 2 different columns in
data=other.inserts, but they should both use the "insert" selection
variable, in geom_point(aes(clickSelects=insert,
showSelected=insert.show, data=other.inserts). See the example in
https://github.com/tdhock/animint-examples/blob/master/examples/scaffolds.R#L65
A better way to define this would be
aes(clickSelects=insert,
    showSelected.variable="insert",
    showSelected.value=insert.show)
Such a syntax would also be useful to avoid the use of for loops when
defining a data viz with many selection variables, as in
https://github.com/tdhock/animint-examples/blob/master/examples/PSJ.R
For loops are bad for two reasons:
- more code to type (144 lines versus 122 lines),
- and slower construction of the data viz (30 seconds versus 1 second).

DSL/RENDER: after clicking and changing the displayed data subset,
zoom/update the axes of related plots. For animations we clearly want
to keep the same axes across animation frames, but for some other
kinds of plots it would be nice if the axes automatically zoomed. We 
currently have theme_animint(update_axes=c("x", "y")) option for single
selection variables for most supported geoms. There should also be a button
next to each axis that you can click to toggle zooming on and off. The
implementation for multiple selection vars may require some computation in
the renderer. See this: https://github.com/tdhock/animint/pull/158

RENDER: move stats computation to the renderer, to support e.g.
examples/stats.R

RENDER: it would be nice to zoom by dragging a rectangle on the plot
background, as in plotly. Then double-click to zoom back out. This lib
might help do the heavy lifting -- https://github.com/romsson/dragit

RENDER: It would be nice to be able to resize plots interactively,
like we can do in shiny+ggvis.

RENDER/DSL: Multiple selection via rectangular brush and/or lasso
https://github.com/skokenes/D3-Lasso-Plugin

RENDER: Easy legend decoding: draw an arrow next to the legend entry
for the value of the element that the mouse is hovering over, e.g.
http://www.highcharts.com/maps/demo/map-drilldown/dark-unica

DSL: To accomplish interactivity like in this plot
http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.ca/2014/05/pdf-chart-inkscape-svg-d3-interactive.html
http://kbroman.github.io/qtlcharts/assets/chartexamples/iplotMScanone_example.html
https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kbroman/D3/car_crashes/
we could write geom_tile(aes(hoverSelects=var)) which means that the
selected value of var should be changed when the user hovers the mouse
over any tile. Raise an error if hoverSelects is used with multiple
selection. For the viz below
http://cpsievert.github.io/LDAvis/newsgroup/newsgroup.html
we could write geom_point(aes(hoverSelects=var, clickSelects=var))
There are thus two kinds of hoverSelects: when you hover away from a
geom, (1) select the previous value or (2) keep the same value. We
could use two different aesthetics: aes(hoverSelectsSticky) and
aes(hoverSelectsLast). Or we could use a geom-level option
geom_point(aes(hoverSelects=var), onMouseOut="selectLast") or
geom_point(aes(hoverSelects=var), onMouseOut="keepSelection"). Or we
could infer a default: aes(hoverSelects=var) implies (2) and
aes(hoverSelects=var, clickSelects=var) implies (1). Which of these 3
methods should we use to define hoverSelects interactivity?

GGPLOT: theme(legend.position)

DSL: how to specify the layout of SVG elements on the page?
- option list(layout=matrix of plot names) means
  render plots in an html table instead of in a line?
- specifying newlines in the option list?
  list(timeSeries=ggplot(),
       newline=list(),
       scatter=ggplot())
  means that we should layout the plots in a <table> with
  2 rows and 1 column.

EXAMPLE: US state population since 1790, compare w/ other countries?
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_by_historical_population
http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histoire_d√©mographique_de_la_France
http://www.populstat.info/Asia/japanc.htm
http://www.populstat.info/Americas/canadac.htm

RENDER: Is it possible to fix geom_rect and geom_text vertical alignment? There is no equivalent of R's vjust in SVG. See examples/align_rect_text.R.

DSL: if there was no duration specified, should
time=list(variable=2000) imply duration=list(variable=1000)?

DSL: geom_tallrect(aes(xmin=chromStart, xmax=chromEnd,
fill=annotation), edit=TRUE) means that we would like to interactively
edit the data in this geom. In particular it means that the specified
aesthetics may be edited by the user (xmin, xmax, fill) but the
non-specified aesthetics may not (e.g. color in the example
above). Save each TSV file with an _animint_id column which is unique
for each drawn element. Start a web server that accepts POST requests
and can edit the TSV files appropriately. This will probably take a
lot of work, and a lot of geom-specific interactive editing code, so
it is more of a research project than a feature request.

RENDER: Should we download all data in the background, even for
non-animated plots? I have started some work on the loadall branch,
but the preliminary answer is NO -- the browser freezes and the plot
does not respond to mouse clicks while the data is loading.

DSL: Implement shape aesthetic with d3.svg.symbol()
https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/SVG-Shapes#symbol_type

RENDER: Determine why border of tiles in pirates example does not seem to be rendering.

RENDER: multiple animints inside of a single shiny app? This is
probably just a theoretical issue. (why not just make a single
animint?)

for single selection showSelected variables.

2016.08.15 PR#166

BUGFIX: no more NA saved to tsv files (even when there is no common
data tsv file).

OPTIMIZATION: getCommonChunk is faster, now we only split by group
(and vectorize over chunks rather than splitting on chunks and doing a
for loop). Also checkCommon returns that a variable is NOT common as
soon as we have at least two chunks for which that variable is
different, for a given group (before, we were checking all chunks).

TEST: getStyleValue now works even if there are some nodes which are
missing the style attribute.

COMPILER: when aes(group) is specified and we have NA values with a
group, we add a new subgroup ID for each run of non-NA
values. Normally in ggplot2 this is important since for example a line
group with two runs of NA values will be rendered as three lines. This
fixes the bug that was combining lines, see
test-renderer4-NA-separate-lines.R

geom_line(aes(showSelected=var1, showSelected2=var2,
showSelected3=var3), chunk_vars=c("var1", "var2")).

2014.4.28

scale_x_continuous(LABEL) specifies the x axis label. Previously, we
could only use xlab(LABEL).

theme_animint(width=600, height=600) instead of option lists which
make us repeat the plot names... I made
tdhock/ggplot2@98cefe4d653ce8f214177b66dc030c2f3c725ffb which lets you
say theme(validate=FALSE) to avoid calling validate_element. This
works with tdhock/animint@c4ff92d8c4edf523d20c6022fb3b515b19974b8b and
I submitted an issue https://github.com/hadley/ggplot2/issues/938 and
pull request.

BUGFIX: the geom drawing order is respected now, even if there are
some geoms which are absent for the current selection. This is
implemented by putting the geoms on each layer in a g element with
class e.g. geom7_vline_scatter. The g element is initialized on plot
startup, and never is deleted, even if there are 0 geoms in the
current selection.

BUGFIX: in the JavaScript, when there are zero groups of line/ribbon
data to display for the current selection, just draw nothing (before
there was an error since the code was written as though there was 1
instead of 0 groups).

2014.4.16

BUGFIX: toJSON gives an infinite recursion error for converting R
functions to JSON, and R functions are sometimes used as ggplot
params/stat_params. But we do not want to pass these to JSON anyway,
so we just ignore them.

2014.4.7

BUGFIX: make_text now works even if it appears before/after certain
other data. See examples/make_text_bug.R

The default/first selection can be specified by an option
first=list(year=1960, country=c("Japan", "United States"). Stop with
an error if multiple values are specified for a single selection
variable.

BUGFIX: Animation now works even for non-numeric variables,
e.g. examples/canada-cities.R.

For animations, start downloading the next chunk for that geom, until
all data is loaded, even if it is not needed on screen right now.

For large data sets such as the scaffold data, breaking the CSV
database from 21 to 94032 CSV files resulted in a 10x increase
in disk space usage (but faster loading of the first data subset),
for 653018 rows of data. Forcing max 1 chunk variable means only
18045 CSV files which is more space/time efficient. Also, plot.json
only stores the chunk ids, not the full filenames (less repetition).

I uploaded these visualizations and timed page loading in chromium:
http://cbio.ensmp.fr/~thocking/scaffold-viz5/ 44.1MB transferred 27.95 s
transfers ALL the data. slow part is 3 csv files, each around 13 MB.
http://cbio.ensmp.fr/~thocking/boxes-fewer-chunks/
transfers only the first subset. 5.6MB transferred 7.73 s.
plot.json is only 304KB, slow part is 1.6MB geom7_point_box_chunk1057.tsv.
http://cbio.ensmp.fr/~thocking/boxes-chunks/ 12.1MB transferred 9.61 s
transfers only the first subset. slow part is 8.7MB plot.json.

Download progress table at the bottom of the plot.
- row for every geom.
- columns: geom, selected chunk, status, downloaded, total.

BUGFIX: stop with an error if width or height list contains plot names
that do not exist!

BUGFIX: when there are commas in text labels, animint.js now parses
the data correctly, since we use tsv instead of csv. See
examples/align_rect_text.R.

Speedy web page loading: on compile, divide data into chunks ---
separate csv files. In general a chunk of data will be shown onscreen
at the same time, but we should not make chunks with only 1 row
e.g. for the WorldBank viz, geom_points should have 1 chunk per year,
geom_text country labels should have 1 chunk per country, and
geom_text year labels should have just 1 chunk which covers all
years. On page load, start downloading the first chunk for each geom.

For geoms with fill=a numeric variable, changing the opacity changes
how we interpret the colors, so for these geoms, show selection by
changing the stroke instead.

2014.3.13

scale_size_animint

2014.2.24

vervet data.

2014.01.27

allow specifying guide="none" in ggplot2 scales that would generate a
legend.

2013.11.22

Test for warnings.

Warn when 0-sized geoms are produced, since they will be invisible.

Do not sort NULL during check for animation values, to avoid warning.

2013.11.19

draw colored, sized "a" in legend for geom_text.

geom_text(aes(size)) is resized using e.g. <text font-size="10">

2013.11.15

Bugfix: filter NaN before passing data to lineThing to avoid hiding an
entire line if only one element is NA.

2013.10.23

Include 1 animint in a knitr Rmd document when processed in the same
directory.

Generate documentation example web site.

Bugfix for geom_point(colour=constant).

2013.10.15

Hide only y axis and not x axis if axis.text.y=element_blank(), etc.

2013.10.4

Bugfixes for geom_ribbon(aes(fill=variable)) and
geom_text(aes(color=variable)).

2013.9.26

Update R/JS comments from emails to Susan.

gg2animint examples are animated and interactive.

2013.8.29
Implementation of geom_hex with relevant examples and documentation.

2013.8.15
Updated package requirements (MASS, reshape2, maps)
Updated documentation to include warnings about using google chrome with animint


2013.7.29
Fix for significant digits issue with clickSelects - fixed by exporting
as character into JSON file, then importing and converting to numerals.

Axes can now be removed for maps

2013.7.26

bugfix for animations: before, we assumed that the animation variable
takes values in 1..n, but now this is treated properly by looking at
the actual values.

make_text for quick labels.

make_*(data, ...)

WARNING when stat_bin is used to put several clickSelects or
showSelected values in the same bin!
